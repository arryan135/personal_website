This multiple-page application is client-side rendered by integrating <span class="italic">React Routers</span>. This app extensively uses <span class="italic">React form validation</span> techniques to ensure that the user avoids adding repetitive colors or color names in the same palette. While ordering the colors during palette creation, this app leverages functionalities from the <span class="italic">React Sortable Higher Order Component(HOC)</span> library to create an invisible grid that allows the two-dimensional movement of the color boxes. This makes ordering color boxes in the palette extremely user-friendly. The app is built upon components from <span class="italic">MaterialUI</span>. And to avoid any specificity conflicts, the custom styles in the app are implemented using <span class="italic">JSS</span>.</p>\n                     <p>To improve readability, the color text dynamically darkens or lightens depending on the surrounding color’s relative luminosity. Using <span class="italic">React’s state management</span>, the app stores and can render eight different scales for all colors in a palette thereby providing the user with more customizable color options. The app also accesses the user’s clipboard to save the selected color’s format in common color representation formats like RGB, RGBA, and HEX. To implement performance optimizations, this app utilizes <span class="italic">React Pure Components</span> to prevent unnecessary renders.

This <span class="italic">React</span> application is a chance-and-strategy dice rolling game that is played over 13 rounds. During each round, the players roll five 6-sided dice. They may click on any number of dice to “freeze” or “unfreeze” them (frozen dice are displayed in a different color), and they may re-roll the unfrozen dice up to 2 times. After each round, the player assigns their dice to any unclaimed scoring category, where each category scores differently. After 13 rounds, the game is over, and the player’s final score is the total of each scoring category.</p>\n                     <p>Developing this <span class="italic">React</span> application, helped me build upon my skills to efficiently design web applications using multiple stateful parent components that pass down their state as props to multiple child components.
