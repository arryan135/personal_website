                        `<p>In the past, I have used coding documentations to review the forgotten functional nuances of many JS frameworks. I even tried making coding cheatsheets. But reading code without actually executing it doesn’t help me review the concepts effectively. Of course, I can always run that code in an IDE. But executing code specific to a framework requires some work like setting up your directory and applying other configurational modifications which can be tedious.</p>
                         <p>Therefore using <span class="italic">React</span> and <span class="italic">Typescript</span>, I developed CheatBook which is an interactive browser-based coding environment. It is like a Jupyter Notebook, but for <span class="italic">JavaScript</span>. It utilizes a cell-based layout where the user can choose between a code editor or a markdown text editor. While using the code editor cell, this app utilizes <span class="italic">Esbuild</span> to transpile and bundle the code and safely execute it directly in the browser. By leveraging web assembly and caching, the execution times are as fast as those of a traditional IDE. All of the complex state within the app is handled using <span class="italic">Redux</span> and <span class="italic">React Hooks</span>. Moreover, this frontend is also patched up to a <span class="italic">NodeJS</span> backend. By using a <span class="italic">Redux middleware</span> and an <span class="italic">Express server</span>, CheatBook persists the contents in the cells on a local JSON file.</p>
                         <p>CheatBook is designed to be used as a CLI on your local machine and you can learn more about its package-based architecture at the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/cheatbook" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NPM registry</a>.</p>

This multiple-page application is client-side rendered by integrating <span class="italic">React Routers</span>. This app extensively uses <span class="italic">React form validation</span> techniques to ensure that the user avoids adding repetitive colors or color names in the same palette. While ordering the colors during palette creation, this app leverages functionalities from the <span class="italic">React Sortable Higher Order Component(HOC)</span> library to create an invisible grid that allows the two-dimensional movement of the color boxes. This makes ordering color boxes in the palette extremely user-friendly. The app is built upon components from <span class="italic">MaterialUI</span>. And to avoid any specificity conflicts, the custom styles in the app are implemented using <span class="italic">JSS</span>.</p>
                         <p>To improve readability, the color text dynamically darkens or lightens depending on the surrounding color’s relative luminosity. Using <span class="italic">React’s state management</span>, the app stores and can render eight different scales for all colors in a palette thereby providing the user with more customizable color options. The app also accesses the user’s clipboard to save the selected color’s format in common color representation formats like RGB, RGBA, and HEX. To implement performance optimizations, this app utilizes <span class="italic">React Pure Components</span> to prevent unnecessary renders. Finally, the app utilizes the browser’s <span class="italic">localStorage</span> object to persist new palettes created by the user. </p>

If any two players’ dot collides, the bigger player’s dot absorbs the other and wins!</p>
                         <p>Developing this game allowed me to use <span class="italic">Socket.io</span> in a game development setting.

The fundamental logic of this game is based on collision detection that is implemented through extensive <span class="italic">JavaScript</span> code for the mathematical logic behind the AABB (Axis-aligned bounding boxes) test and the Pythagoras test.

                        <p>Task Manager is a <span class="italic">NodeJS API</span>, whose different routes(get, post, patch, delete) are implemented using <span class="italic">Express</span> and the schema for a user and a task is implemented using <span class="italic">Mongoose</span>. All the routes in the API use a custom <span class="italic">Express middleware</span> that leverages capabilities from <span class="italic">JSON Web Tokens</span> to ensure effective authentication. In this way, users are authorized to only read, update or delete their own tasks. To protect the users' login credentials in the database, all the passwords are hashed before storage. Through the <span class="italic">SendGrid API</span>, authenticated users are also able to send emails using <span class="italic">NodeJS</span>.

They may click on any number of dice to “freeze” or “unfreeze” them (frozen dice are displayed in a different color), and they may re-roll the unfrozen dice up to 2 times. After each round, the player assigns their dice to any unclaimed scoring category, where each category scores differently. After 13 rounds, the game is over, and the player’s final score is the total of each scoring category.</p>
                         <p>Developing this <span class="italic">React</span> application, helped me build upon my skills to efficiently design web applications using multiple stateful parent components that pass down their state as props to multiple child components. Every click to either roll the dice or score points, fires custom <span class="italic">CSS animations</span>, executes extensive rule checking <span class="italic">JavaScript</span> code and, according to the results of those rules, triggers several event handlers that alter the state in multiple parent and child <span class="italic">React</span> components.
